# GODcoin

GODcoin is the official currency of Christ. A single token is backed by one
physical gram of gold. Blockchain technology is used to provide an immutable and
cryptographically verified ledger. The system is centralized allowing for global
scalability that would otherwise be foregone in a decentralized system.
